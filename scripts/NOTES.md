Earth System Model (ESM) diagnostics serve several purposes:

1. **Model evaluation**: Diagnostics help assess how well an ESM simulates various components of the Earth's
system, such as climate, ocean circulation, and atmospheric chemistry.
2. **Process understanding**: By analyzing diagnostic output, scientists can gain insights into specific processes
that occur within the model, allowing for a better understanding of their representation in the model.
3. **Identifying biases and errors**: Diagnostics help identify potential biases or errors in the model's
performance, which can be used to refine model parameters, improve the underlying physics, or adjust the model's
configuration.
4. **Improving model predictions**: By identifying areas where the model is performing poorly, scientists can take
steps to improve its predictive capabilities, such as updating model parameterizations, incorporating new data, or
implementing advanced algorithms.
5. **Supporting scientific research and decision-making**: Diagnostics provide valuable information for scientists
and policymakers, enabling them to better understand complex Earth system processes and make informed decisions
about climate mitigation and adaptation strategies.

Common diagnostic metrics used in ESMs include:

* Climate indices (e.g., temperature, precipitation)
* Ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns
* Carbon cycle components (e.g., CO2 concentrations, methane emissions)
* Weather extremes and climate variability
* Water cycle metrics (e.g., evaporation, river discharge)

These diagnostics help scientists to refine their understanding of the Earth system, improve model predictions,
and ultimately inform decision-making related to climate policy, resource management, and sustainable development.
